# Neovim Setup

This repository hosts my current Neovim configuration files. This is the updated version
that uses lua only to set things up.

## How to use

- run `PackerSync` to install listed plugins

## Features

- `Packer`: a Lua based plugin manager
- `Colorschemes`: includes my favourite colorschemes such as gruvbox, tokyonight and dracula
- `Telescope`: a fuzzy finder for finding files, grepping text, picking code actions etc. with dev icon support
